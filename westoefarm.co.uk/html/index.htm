<h2>Westoe Farm</h2>

<p>Tranquil views (and a welcome cup of tea) greet you on arrival at this warm and comfortable flint and brick farmhouse.</p>

<p>You will feel relaxed right away in this recently renovated family home where a separate wing on the ground floor, once the original cattle barn, provides beautifully furnished guest accommodation. Guests can also relax in the drawing room with the papers surrounded by the family's varied collection of African wildlife artefacts and paintings.</p>

<p>Albertine and Dreaming Spires climbing roses scramble over the walls, creating a fragrant veil over the house and adjoining barn. Beyond the tennis court and swimming pool, the open garden blends seamlessly into surrounding farmland and foods, perfect for an evening stroll.</p>

<p>Guests are offered an evening meal by arrangement using as much produce from the farm or local sources as possible.</p>

<h3>TIM & HENRIETTA - YOUR HOSTS</h3>

<p>Tim and Henrietta are young, energetic and enthusiastic and entertain guests with the same verve and panache as they approach their many other interests. Tim spent 18 years in The Grenadier Guards serving in Northern Ireland and Germany before coming home to run the family farming business in 1996. Henrietta is a keen horsewoman and excellent cook, and runs a ski holiday business in France in the winter.</p>
